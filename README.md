## Key Features

- **Multiple views**: Board view, list view, and table view
- **Sub-boards**: Create hierarchical kanban structures by linking cards to other boards. Cards automatically show open task counts, and breadcrumb navigation makes it easy to move between parent and child boards. See [Sub-boards documentation](./docs/How%20do%20I/Use%20sub-boards.md).
- **Date and time tracking**: Add dates with calendar picker, display relative dates
- **Metadata integration**: Works with Dataview and Tasks plugins
- **Tag colors**: Customize tag appearance on cards
- **Archive**: Archive completed cards for later reference
