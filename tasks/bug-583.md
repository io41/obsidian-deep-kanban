## Description

### Describe the bug

When both Sliding Panes and Kanban plugins are enabled, and two kanban panes are adjacent. I intented to drag and drop a card to a different list in the same kanban pane, however, it may has chance to fall into the other kanban pane behind the current one. It is quite annoying because I cannot drag and drop that card back to the original kanban.

### Expected Behavior

When dragging and dropping a card in the kanban, the card should be moved inside the current kanban, not to the other one.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Enable both Sliding Panes and Kanban plugins.
2. Open two kanban panes. Their title bars are adjacent, but their panes are overlapping, one pane is covering over the other one.
3. Drag and drop a card in the front kanban, the card may fall into the other kanban behind the current one.
