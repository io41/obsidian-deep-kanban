## Description

### Describe the bug

Sometimes, dragging a card from one list to another, it's impossible to add it at the bottom of the list -- the last card will move down to allow inserting above, but will not move up to allow inserting below.

(Note: all of the columns are larger than will fit in the screen, so scrollbars are active.  Cards are varying heights.)

### Expected Behavior

_No response_

### Steps to reproduce

I have not been able to consistently reproduce this -- some columns in a board do it, and others don't.  The specific thing that happens is that when it's not working, the last card in the target does not float up to leave a gap at the bottom, but instead simply closes the gap above.

It seems that when the problem is occurring, I can stop it by forcing an upward scroll (by dragging up) then back down again.  Once that happens, the column seems willing to accept items at the bottom again, until whatever triggers it, triggers it again.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
