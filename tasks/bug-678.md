## Description

### Describe the bug

If the option to "Display card checkbox" in Kanban settings is turned off, then the card checkbox should also not appear when opening the board in Markdown.

Yes, the checkbox is gone in the board display:

But it's still there when we open the board in Markdown:

The Markdown should reflect the board's use of checkboxes, on or off.

Thank you! And thanks for a terrific plugin.

### Expected Behavior

### Steps to reproduce

1. In the Kanban settings, turn off the option to "Display card checkbox."
2. Create a new card in the Kanban. No checkbox is displayed.
3. Open the board in Markdown. The checkbox *is* displayed but should not be.
