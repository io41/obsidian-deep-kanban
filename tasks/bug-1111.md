title: Glitch when moving card between lists with board displayed in a narrow tab

investigation_notes: "DnD glitch when board in narrow tab smaller than card width. Root cause: Scroll trigger zones were hardcoded at 35px from each edge. In narrow containers (<70px wide), the left and right zones would overlap, causing conflicting scroll directions and the 'shaking' behavior. Fixed by making scroll zones proportional to container size (20% of dimension), with min 10px and max 35px. This prevents zone overlap in narrow containers while maintaining good UX in normal-sized containers."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When dragging a card from one list to another in a board being displayed in a narrow tab -- narrower than the default width of a card, the display glitches and the card sometimes cannot be moved to the new list successfully.

### Expected Behavior

The card should move to the new list without the display glitching, and it should work everytime, not just occasionally.

### Steps to reproduce

make a kanban board with two lists
open the board in a tab
set to "view as list"
make a card in one list.
shrink the tab width to be smaller than the default width of the list.
click the card and try to drag it to the the other list
--> you will see the kanban board shake back and forth rapidly as the mouse is moved around, as if it's trying to re-size something.
try and drop the card on the on the other list
--> you will _sometimes_ be successful, but other time the card will snap back to the original list.
