## Description

### Describe the bug

If you open note that was already active in **board** view with the quick switcher or through the URI `open` action it becomes blank until you switch to a different note and back, or to markdown view and back.

### Expected Behavior

The note should just remain open in board view instead of turning blank.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a board.
Ensure is in kanban view and the currently open tab.
Open the quick switcher, and select the note.
When it is "re-opened" it will be blank.

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell

```

### Operating system

macOS
