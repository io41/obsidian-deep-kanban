investigation_notes: "Investigated renderMarkdown.ts - link click handler uses Keymap.isModEvent(evt) which is the correct Obsidian API for detecting modifier keys (Cmd+Alt=split, etc). Code appears correct. Bug from 2022 may have been fixed in subsequent updates or was platform-specific. Needs user testing to confirm."
