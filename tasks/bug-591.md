## Description

### Describe the bug

I create tasks with inline metadata for things like project name. This looks like this:

`- [ ]  [project:: project name] testing`

However, this renders without the `project name' in kanban view:

### Expected Behavior

the rendering should include the value of the metadata field, in this case `project name`

### Steps to reproduce

Simply cut and paste my example in a kanban board.

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
None.
```


### Operating system

macOS
