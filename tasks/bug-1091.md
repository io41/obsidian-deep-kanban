## Description

### Describe the bug

When in the middle of editing a card, if you go to drag a different card, the pending edits are lost

### Expected Behavior

Either the card should remain in edit state, or the changes should be saved

### Steps to reproduce

On the board view:
- Start editing a card and add/delete a few characters
- Without saving the changes to the card, start dragging a different card to a different position on the board
- The original card switches out of the edit state and the changes are lost

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

macOS
