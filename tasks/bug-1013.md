## Description

### Describe the bug

When I try to write something through card additions, there's an abnormally large space. I don't know how that happened. Also, the Enter key is dead. Pressing Enter won't close the card.

### Expected Behavior

The type must be added normally. In addition, the enter key must also function normally.

### Steps to reproduce
