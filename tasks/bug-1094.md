## Description

### Describe the bug

When I've added a tag colour setting inside a board, then all the global tag colours get ignored which in itself might be expected behaviour. However, removing all board-specific tag colours doesn't make the board revert to the global tag colours, but instead the setting stays empty and only the default tag colour is displayed. There is no button to revert the board-specific tag colour setting instead of it being set to empty value `[]`.

### Expected Behavior

Removing all board-specific tag colours should make the board use the global tag colours. There should be a revert button next to board-specific tag colours, if not at all times, then at least when `tag-color == []`.

Alternatively, there should be a new board-specific setting whether global tag colours should be applied, so one might combine both board-specific and global tag colours.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a board-specific tag colour
2. Remove it
3. Tag colours stay default, global tag colours get ignored (the board setting "tag-color" is set to an empty list `[]`)

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
