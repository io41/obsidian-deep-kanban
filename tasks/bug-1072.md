investigation_notes: "Vim mode :w command doesn't save card edits. The kanban editor doesn't integrate with vim's save command. Related to #1123 (save on blur) - with that fix, clicking outside saves. But vim save command still won't work."

## Description

### Describe the bug

What's happening: I use vim mode for all obsidian file editing. The new kanban will use vim mode when I try to edit a card. Making changes in vim mode on a card does not write to the underlying markdown file (so the change will not be saved). 

When does it happen: when editing kanban card in vim mode.

### Expected Behavior

When I type ':w' in vim command or try to save the file (for example, in macos CMD+S), the update to the card should be saved. (reflect in the markdown file). 

### Steps to reproduce

Install kanban and enable vim mode in obsidian. Create a kanban file. Create a new card. Edit this card in kanban view mode.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

macOS
