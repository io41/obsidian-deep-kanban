## Description

### Describe the bug

Both on mobile and desktop, horizontal scrolling across a 7 column kanban board is way too fast for it to be usable. 

### Expected Behavior

- Slower scroll speed
- Larger threshold to stop scrolling while dragging an object to drop it in to a column


### Steps to reproduce

To repro, drag an item across the board to reach a column out of view, and it's hard to drop it one-two columns over because it rushes to scroll all the way.

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell

```

### Operating system

Windows
