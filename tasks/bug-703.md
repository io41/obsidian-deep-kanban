## Description

### Describe the bug

Regardless of selection, hitting either **Enter** or **Shift + Enter** will always trigger a new line—and neither will create and complete the editing of a card or list. I’ve tested combinations of settings set in global vs board, but the result is always the same. I also created a brand new vault to ensure other plugins weren’t conflicting with Kanban. Haven’t tried on macOS yet.

11” iPad Pro w/ Apple Magic Keyboard iPadOS 16.1.1
Obsidian v.1.4.1

### Expected Behavior

If the *New line trigger* setting is set to *Enter*, it’s expected that hitting **Enter** on the keyboard will trigger a new line and hitting **Shift + Enter** will create and complete the editing of a card or list. If the *New line trigger* is set to *Shift + Enter*, it’s expected that hitting **Shift + Enter** will trigger a new line and hitting **Enter** will create and complete the editing of a card or list.

### Steps to reproduce

Relatively new to Obsidian, this is just how it’s been working out of the box. I even tested in a brand new vault to make certain there were no plugin conflicts causing the problem.

### Relevant errors (if available)
