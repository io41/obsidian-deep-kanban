## Description

### Describe the bug

When starting Obsidian it immediately shows a toast saying this plugin failed to load. When that happens, it throws this into the console.



### Expected Behavior

No error, plugins loads.

### Steps to reproduce

Latest Obsidian, install plugin, enable plugin.

That's it on my pc anyway.
