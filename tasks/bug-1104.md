## Description

### Describe the bug

Hello, just installed Kanban for the first time in my machine and wasn't being able to toggle back to Kanban mode after choosing Markdown mode. I checked the documentation and saw that there should be more options in the command palette, but in my case there is only one (image below).

_No response_
