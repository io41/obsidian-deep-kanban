## Description

### Describe the bug

Currently, this problem frequently occurs in Kanban: After editing new content on a card, one may forget to press the Enter key and directly carry out other operations, and then the newly edited content of this card will not be saved.

### Expected Behavior

After I edit the content of a card, without pressing the Enter key, I can directly perform any other operations. For example, directly clicking on other blank areas of Kanban or directly creating a new card, or switching to other plugins or documents. The content of the card that has just been edited will be automatically saved.

### Steps to reproduce

Example: I create a new card B in Kanban and write some new content C in card B. Then, without pressing the Enter key, I directly click on other blank areas of Kanban with the mouse or directly create a new card D. After that, I switch to other documents or plugins, or directly exit the software. When I come back to Kanban again, I find that all the previously edited content C has disappeared, which means there is no auto-saving feature. #
