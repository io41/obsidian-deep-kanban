## Description

### Describe the bug

First:
I was trying to create a new card to present a task with a time, and date on the board.
The Second:
I created a new note from this card.
Then I checked my Calendars and another calendar plugin, but couldn't present this task/note.
That's too hard to track.

### Expected Behavior

_No response_

### Steps to reproduce

I checked the date/time format from the calendar plugin, daily plugin, and Kanban.

### Relevant errors (if available)
