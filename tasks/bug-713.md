## Description

### Describe the bug

On every change to the kanban board YAML frontmatter containing Dataview metadata in the format "key:: value: is rewritten and rendered unusable.
This does not happen to "key: value".
Works for ":"
Breaks for "::"

**Before:**
```
---
key1: value1
key2:: value2
kanban-plugin: basic
---
```

**After:**
```
---

key1: value1
"key2:": value2
kanban-plugin: basic

---
```

### Expected Behavior

YAML frontmatter should remain untouched and not formatted in any way.
No blank lines should be added
Dataview metadata in the specified with double ":" should be rewritten unchanged.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create new empty kanban board
2. Switch to source mode
3. Add Dataview metadata to YAML frontmatter
4. Switch to view mode
5. Change kanban board (add card or list)
6. Switch to source mode
-> YAML frontmatter is changed

### Relevant errors (if available)
