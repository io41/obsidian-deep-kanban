## Description

### Describe the bug

Using Obsidian v1.7.3 on Mac OS Sonoma 14.6.1.

I have pinned tabs with two kanbans in them. When typing in another note, I'm seeing this error all the time, which I believe is making Obsidian less responsive:

`plugin:obsidian-kanban:47 [Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchstart' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive. See https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5745543795965952`

### Expected Behavior

Not to throw that violation.

### Steps to reproduce

I just type in another note with the kanban in a non-visible tab.

### Relevant errors (if available)

### Operating system
