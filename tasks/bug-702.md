investigation_notes: "Panning/scrolling on Android touches links and opens them immediately instead of waiting for tap-and-release. Added touch tracking in renderMarkdown.ts to detect scroll gestures (movement > 10px threshold) and prevent link activation when scrolling."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When touching and sliding on the screen for panning/scrolling, any link that gets touched instantly opens.
This is very problematic in Kanbans with many inserted links, as panning/scrolling constantly opens these links.

### Expected Behavior

When touching and sliding, the screen should always pan/scroll thought the Kanban lists.
Links should only open after a quick tapping (i.e. touching and releasing) them.


### Steps to reproduce

Create Kanban with links inserted. Try to touch and slide finger on phone screen to pan/scroll in any direction. If the initial touch is near a link, this link will be activated/opened right away, thereby preventing the intended scrolling.

### Relevant errors (if available)
