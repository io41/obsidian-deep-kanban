## Description

### Describe the bug

When using iPadOS the drag/drop function is only okay. Sometimes it works, but grabs a URL to the card and creates a new card in the lane you tried to drag to. This seems to happen if you click on the name of the card once it's linked to a note. Sometimes it grabs nothing and nothing happens. 

Sometimes it does work if you click/hold, but I find that the tolerance there is not reliable.

Touch is reliable, but as we get Stage Manager, Obsidian will end up on non-touch enabled screens with no way to interact with it.

### Expected Behavior

You should be able to use drag and drop on the cards. Even if you click on the title of the card that is linked to a note, it should grab the whole card not the link to the note.

A possible interim solution would be adding more keyboard commands and a highlight so that you could move cards around with keyboard commands. If I knew which card I had highlighted then I could move it between lanes with a keyboard command. I have no idea if that's easier than fixing the drag/drop functions with the trackpad.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a Kanban board in iPadOS and test out various card settings for drag/drop with a trackpad.
