issue: 550
title: Dataview cannot be rendered in Kanban

investigation_notes: "Embedded dataview queries show blank in kanban cards. Kanban uses ObsidianRenderer.render() (MarkdownRenderer.tsx:91-97) which should trigger all post-processors including Dataview. Bug is from 2022 and Dataview has been updated significantly since then. Issue likely depends on complex interaction between embedded file processing, Dataview post-processor timing, and Obsidian's markdown pipeline. Needs current testing to verify if still occurring with latest Dataview version."
