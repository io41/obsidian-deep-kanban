investigation_notes: "Visual-only card duplication after drag/drop - markdown file shows correct state. Likely a React state/rendering issue where UI doesn't match actual data. Toggling view mode resets the UI correctly. Related to #943. Complex state management bug."

## Description

### Describe the bug

Sometimes (looks random but I just do not understand the behaviour), after moving a card from one column to another one, the kanban board immediately duplicates every cards. Clicking `open as markdown` show only normal cards lists without duplicate. Then, clicking back to `open as kanban board` make the duplicates disappear. 

Example of duplicated board:

### Expected Behavior

No duplication of cards after card move.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a few columns, then create a few cards, then drag and drop one card from one column to the other one

### Relevant errors (if available)
