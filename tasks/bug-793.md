## Description

### Describe the bug

When using the **Red **Graphite** theme specifically, the lanes in Kanban are not adopting the text color/box color references and become black on black and unreadable.

### Expected Behavior

When the theme is applied, Kanban adopts the global settings from the theme and adapts accordingly.

### Steps to reproduce

Install the kanban plugin and the Red Graphite theme.  In light mode, create a Kanban board.
