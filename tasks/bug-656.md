## Description

### Describe the bug

I activated the feature to color the date.

### Expected Behavior

The relative date and the date (depending on which has been activated) should show the correct colors.
When two colors are set, the most recent one should be chosen.
This would make it possible to have red dates for close deadlines, orange for upcoming, and blue for not anytime soon

### Steps to reproduce

- obsidian 0.16.4
- minimal theme
- kanban plugin
