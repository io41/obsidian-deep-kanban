## Description

### Describe the bug

![image](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/assets/19514231/74ffd8c4-ffc1-410d-aa6c-3f40141f8209)

If you add multiple dates using `@`, they all show up, but once clicking on one to edit, it'll always apply the edited value to the first date only.

### Expected Behavior

Clicking on any of the dates added should edit only the one clicked, and leave the others untouched.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Add multiple dates to the body of a card using `@`
2. Click on any of them to edit
3. Edit the date using the date picker
4. Notice that it changes the value of the first date only

### Relevant errors (if available)
