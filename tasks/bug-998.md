investigation_notes: "User on Windows reports both Enter and Shift+Enter create newlines regardless of setting. Different from #579 (mobile issue). The allowNewLine logic looks correct for desktop. May be related to CodeMirror keymap configuration or another plugin conflict. Needs more investigation."

## Description

### Describe the bug

I have set the option for 'new line trigger' to shift + enter and yet when I put enter by itself it creates a new line and if I push shift and enter it creates a new line, but it wont save the card and allow me to create a new card, essentially I am stuck in editing mode and cant get out of it by pushing enter. I have tried switching the 'new line trigger' to just enter but that doesn't fix the issue, both shift + enter and just enter create a new line no matter what setting I put it to.  I wanted to see maybe if its just my vault so I made a brand new one with no other plugins and this problem still persisted 

### Expected Behavior

when I push enter it should take me out of editing the card so I can create another card and not delete all the things I wrote in a card when I try and click out of the card

### Steps to reproduce

push enter and see a new line will be created, push shift + enter and a new line will be created, there is no way to get out of the editing mode and save your writing 

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
