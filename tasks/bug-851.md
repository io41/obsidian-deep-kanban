## Description

### Describe the bug

When setting a color definitions for the date display they do not work!
I did try to set them globally and on the specific kaban.

Dates should be displayed in the specified color. Also if they are specified to be displayed relativ!

### Steps to reproduce

Configure a color difinition for the date display and define a Task with a date which should be colored.
