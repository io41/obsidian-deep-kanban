issue: 1078
title: keeps converting my boards to a note

investigation_notes: "iOS: Board randomly converts to note view when navigating away and back. Root cause: When iOS app returns from background, the metadata cache may not be populated yet. The setViewState hook only checked the cache for frontmatter, missing kanban files whose cache wasn't ready. Fixed by adding a fallback check: if we previously opened the file as kanban (stored in kanbanFileModes), use that as evidence even when cache is unavailable."
