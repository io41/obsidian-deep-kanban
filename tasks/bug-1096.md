## Description

### Describe the bug

Console error message when renaming the kanban board from the tab.



### Expected Behavior

No error message?
It seems to update the name just fine. It seems a mild issue, though I have no links to that particular kanban board, yet, so I don't necessarily know the impact.

### Steps to reproduce

Click the tab of the kanban board, rename it. Error message appears.

### Relevant errors (if available)
