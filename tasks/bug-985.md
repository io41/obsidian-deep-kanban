## Description

### Describe the bug

I have Obsidian Tasks v7.4.0 and Kanban v2.0.51 and whenever I am creating a new card and the tasks pane pops up above the editor (I'll have another bug report on that one as it is always staying up) and I go to add anything like a due date or start date or whatever, it gives this error.
