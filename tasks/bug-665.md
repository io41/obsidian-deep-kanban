investigation_notes: "iOS Safari has issues with flex containers where children don't shrink properly without min-height: 0. The lane-items scroll container was overflowing instead of shrinking, pushing the Add card button out of view. Fixed by adding flex: 1, min-height: 0 to lane-items and overflow: hidden to lane."
