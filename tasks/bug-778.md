## Description

### Describe the bug

I don't use the YYYY-MM-DD format for my daily notes. Instead, I use YYYY.MM.DD.

When I enable "Link to Daily Notes", despite the `date shown` and `date text` on my cards being YYYY.MM.DD (because this is what I specified in the Date format boxes), the `link` is still treated as the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. When I click it, it generates a new note in `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

This is despite the fact that, in `Pure Markdown` mode, the link is actually `[[YYYY.MM.DD.md]]`. It seems that in Kanban mode, the link is still treated as `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

### Expected Behavior

Clicking on a date in the Kanban view should use the same `date` format specified in `Date format`.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Change Date format in both Date boxes to something else: eg., YYYY.MM.DD
2. Enable "Link to Daily Notes"
3. Add a date to a card
4. Click the date. 

A new note with the title format YYYY-MM-DD.md will be created, despite the new `Date` format specified in settings.
