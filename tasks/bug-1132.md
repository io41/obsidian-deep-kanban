## Description

### Describe the bug

Using Obsidian v1.8.1 on Mac OS Sequioa 15.4.1.

The plugin seems to be blocking using common shortcuts like opening the command palette, quick switch or a simple cmd + f. Only way to get them to work again is by running the 'Reload app without saving' command.

Happens very often for me, but only been able to reproduce it when switching between kanban and markdown view.

I did the test in a new vault with only this plugin, so I am 100% sure it's not affected by keyboard shortcut configs or other plugins. 

This is the error I see in the dev tools

plugin:obsidian-kanban:47 [Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchstart' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive. See https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5745543795965952

### Expected Behavior

Expected Behavior
After switching to markdown view it should let you execute keyboard shortcuts

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open a kanban
2. Click on Add a car
3. Now that we are focused in that input, switch to markdown view (either with the button or the command)
4. Try a keyboard shortcut like cmd + f

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
