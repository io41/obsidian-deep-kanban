## Description

### Describe the bug

When working in Kanban, I created internal wiki links to canvases. But when I click on the link to jump to the canvas it tries to ask me which application on my system I would like to open the file with externally, rather than simply jumping to the canvas as with other notes.

I am using the Obsidian Flatpak on Arch Linux. Thank you for making this amazing plugin!

### Expected Behavior

When I click on any canvas link in a kanban, it should open the canvas within Obsidian like any other note.

### Steps to reproduce

Create internal link in kanban > Click on internal link.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Linux
