## Description

### Describe the bug

After some recent update the behavior has changed.
Before, when I dragged one card out of the window and into another, it would try to scroll for a fraction of a second on the screen that was leaving as I approached the edge, then would also try to scroll for a fraction of a second the one that was entering... while I was close to the edge of a window.

Now it scroll both windows simultaneously which is a big problem.
Let's say I drag a card from a window on the left to a window on the right. 
When I approach the edge of the left window, it will scroll all of them all the way showing what else is on the right side of that board. But as soon as I cross into the other window, it will scroll all the way to the opposite side. Sometimes it will jump forth and back rapidly on the scrolling since it can clearly decide if I am on one side or the other.

It's a mess. I really liked this functionality of moving cards between boards on a drag and drop fashion, but now it is extremely hard to use. 

Having three windows makes it even more ridiculous, since all three will scroll at the same time. So If the card is getting close to the edge on the left window, the window on the center and the window on the right will scroll as well.

### Expected Behavior

Only scroll the window where the card/mouse is
As a workaround, I am opening now the windows one on top of the other rather than side by side to avoid this issue
A possible solution would be a toggle on the settings page to simple turn off the auto scroll when dragging a card. Or a hotkey to such function (so it is on when using a single board, but is easy to turn off when multiple board are open)

### Steps to reproduce

Create two boards
Open them side by side on two windows
Create multiple columns/list on them
Create one card anywhere
Click and drag that card from one board to the other
