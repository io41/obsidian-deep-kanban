## Description

### Describe the bug

I've got Obsidian installed and working. As far as I can tell all my other plugins and Obsidian features are working. The KanBan appears as it should. However, when attempting to drag cards though it does not respond or do anything. I see other older issues say the plugin does not load with an error message, but I do not get that.

### Expected Behavior

The cards should be able to be dragged between lists

### Steps to reproduce

1. I enabled Linux mode on the Chromebook
2. I followed [this guide](https://jonbeckett.medium.com/how-to-install-and-use-obsidian-on-a-chromebook-236b5a81e421) to install it
3. I enabled all plugins and turned off restriction mode
4. I tried to drag my cards around, but nothing happens.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Linux
