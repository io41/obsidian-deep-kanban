investigation_notes: "Non-markdown files (pdf, images, docx) being rendered as embeds instead of links. The linkTo() function uses Obsidian's generateMarkdownLink. The rendering behavior may have changed in Obsidian itself. Needs investigation into whether there's a way to force link vs embed mode for non-md files."

## Description

### Describe the bug

I am using Markdown links in my vault.

Previously, when dragging a non-markdown file (.docx, .pptx, .pdf, image files...) onto the Knaban board the file name was displayed. Clicking on the filename opened the file externally to Onsidian with the associated app.

This was a useful way to attach external documents to a Kanban board.

Since the last release, the Kanban plugin attempts to render the file on the card. For .pdf files the heavily cropped top right corner of the file is rendered. Image files are rendered as a thumbnails. For other files, the rendered version of the filename is displayed.

### Expected Behavior

When a non-markdown file is added to a Kanban board, the plugin should revert to previous behavior and display the filename as a link that can be clicked on to launch the file in an external app.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Drag a non-markdown file to the Kanban board.
2. Confirm that a rendered version of the file is displayed.

### Relevant errors (if available)
