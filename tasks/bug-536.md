## Description

### Describe the bug

Currently Kanban doesn't move notes to a set folder if the path contains hyphens



### Expected Behavior

Kanban should be able to parse folder paths /names with hyphens and eventually other non illegal punctuation characters

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a folder "1-test" in your root
2. Set this folder to your note folder
3. Create a note inside your Kanban

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

macOS
