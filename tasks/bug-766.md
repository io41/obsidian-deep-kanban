## Description

### Describe the bug

When using the iPad with the Magic Keyboard, Obsidian almost feels identical to how it does on my MacBook. On a kanban board, the trackpad / mouse works with the buttons e.g. the 3 dot menus on each card. It works to add a card, but when you want to submit, it doesn’t take mouse / trackpad input. It works if you press on the touchscreen. Particularly annoying when using Obsidian on an external display. 

### Expected Behavior

Submit button should respond to mouse / trackpad click

### Steps to reproduce

Use a wireless mouse or Magic Keyboard with iPad. Add or edit a card in a Kanban board. Cannot press submit with the mouse / trackpad.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

iOS
