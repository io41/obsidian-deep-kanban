## Description

### Describe the bug

When I start writing a new card the text is pale grey on white, which is just about impossible to read. I'm using Obsidian on a Macbook Air M2 with latest Obsidian (early release... 1.5.3) and have the latest version of the plugin. Default theme... Dark.

### Expected Behavior

I expect a higher contrast text so that I can see what I'm doing.

### Steps to reproduce

Open Obsidian, set theme as above. Install Kanban plugin. Open new card... editing test is pale grey on white.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

macOS
