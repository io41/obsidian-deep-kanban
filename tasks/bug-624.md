## Description

### Describe the bug

The code in this line is assigning empty aliases to links, as it does not check whether the alias is empty: https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/blob/d90c4a213624143906f026f71e2e1515bc597f69/src/components/Item/helpers.ts#L696-L698

The result is that you end up with blank-looking cards with unusable links when dragging links from live preview mode in 0.16.

### Expected Behavior

The link should not be created with an empty alias - the alias should simply be omitted entirely in that case (if wikilinks are in use) or the default left alone (for markdown links).

(In other words, the alias replacement should just be skipped if the alias is an empty string.)


### Steps to reproduce

In Obsidian 0.16 with wikilinks enabled, drag an internal link from live preview mode and drop it on a kanban board.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
