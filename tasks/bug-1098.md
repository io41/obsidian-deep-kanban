status: fixed
investigation_notes: "Chinese characters upside down in collapsed lane title. CSS used writing-mode: vertical-lr with rotate(180deg) which flips CJK characters incorrectly. Fix: use writing-mode: vertical-rl without rotation - this naturally orients CJK characters while rotating Latin text 90 degrees."
