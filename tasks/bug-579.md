## Description

### Describe the bug

When you press `enter` on iPadOS with text in a card it does **not** create a new card. Toggling the `Shift Enter` option to create new line/new card does nothing.

### Expected Behavior

Based on the user setting, a new card should be created with `Enter` or `Shift Enter`.

### Steps to reproduce

Create Kanban board in iPadOS and then create a card. Pressing `Enter` to complete the card does not create a new card. It always creates a new line.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

iOS
