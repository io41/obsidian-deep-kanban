## Description

### Describe the bug

`obsidian-kanban` has been firing events upon several operations that changes a board's state, and I've been relying on it for building another obsidian plugin. Now these are all gone starting from https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/commit/e34ebefbcce3726c8a8da5675ef144e6ce86961a.

Please revert this change.

### Expected Behavior

_No response_

### Steps to reproduce

Open console, execute
```
app.workspace.on('kanban:card-moved', (...args) => { for (let a of args) { console.log(a); } console.log(args.length + " arguments")})
```
and see if anything is logged while moving cards around.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system
