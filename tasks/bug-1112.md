## Description

### Describe the bug

We cannot use the left- and right-arrow keys to move the cursor while editing a list title.

If your cursor is in the middle of a string and you …

- hit LEFT, you move to the end of the string
- hit RIGHT, you move to the next tab

If your cursor is in the end of a string and you …
- hit LEFT, you move to the previous tab
- hit RIGHT, you move to the next tab


### Expected Behavior

I expect the cursor to move to the previous or next _character_.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Make a new kanban board.
2. Type some text in a list title.
3. Hit either arrow key.

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell

```

### Operating system

Windows
