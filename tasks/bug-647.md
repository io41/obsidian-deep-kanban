All issues either fixed or controlled by settings."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When writing text to cards, some markdown syntax styles are not parsed as expected. I am attaching three example cards with raw text:
- Test1 #tag1
- Test2 @{2022-09-29}
- Test3 ==highlight==

The result looks like this:

### Expected Behavior

- Test1: Since the tag shows up nicely at the bottom of the card, there is no need to show it again in the card text
- Test2: Since the date shows up nicely formatted at the bottom of the card, the display of the raw date text is distracting and could be hidden. Actually this is what I see in many Youtube videos about using Kanban with Obsidian. But in my case, the raw date string does not seem to vanish for whatever reason. 
- Test3: The highlighted text is not highlighted, while it would get highlighted as expected in other Obsidian markdown files.

### Steps to reproduce

Add Kanban cards as described above.
Maybe one of my settings in one of my plugins or themes could be responsible, instead of Kanban itself? (I am a basic user and did not fiddle around a lot yet).
