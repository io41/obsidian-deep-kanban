## Description

### Describe the bug

Thanks for developing and maintaining this awesome plugin.

I can add a default folder within the general settings. But I can't do that in the kanban-board specific settings. Check the screenshots below.

**General Settings**

**Kanban-board (internal) Settings**

I'm not fully sure whether this is a bug, or a lacking feature. If it's a bug, please consider fixing it.

If it's a lacking feature, it would be awesome if we could assign default folders per Kanban-board.

### Expected Behavior

_No response_

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open the General settings through the Kanban settings menu.
