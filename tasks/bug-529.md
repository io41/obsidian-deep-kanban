## Description

### Describe the bug

Trying to activate the plugin on Android results in an error message and it stays unactivated. This is probably the same error as #281.

System information:
Android 9
Obsidian app: 1.2.0
obsidian-kanban 1.2.39

Things I've tried already:
- Uninstalling and reinstalling Kanban.
- Uninstalling and reinstalling Obsidian.
- I'm able to install and enable other community plugins.
- Uninstall all other community plugins.

I've debugged this over adb and retrieved a further error message through the Chrome developer tools console. The minimized obsidian js is difficult to debug, so I'm not sure where to go from there. Let me know if there is any other information I could provide, or strategies I could use to debug this further.

### Expected Behavior

The plugin should be activated.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Under "Community Plugins" click Kanban and "Install".
2. Click "Enable".

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
Error in app:
Failed to load plugin obsidian-kanban

Error in developer tools console:
app.js:1 Plugin failure: obsidian-kanban SyntaxError: Unexpected token .
    at eval (<anonymous>)
    at app.js:1
    at e.<anonymous> (app.js:1)
    at app.js:1
    at Object.next (app.js:1)
    at s (app.js:1)

And after prettifying the js the stack trace becomes:
app.js:formatted:1 Plugin failure: obsidian-kanban SyntaxError: Unexpected token .

    at e.<anonymous> (app.js:formatted:1)
