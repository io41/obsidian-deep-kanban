## Description

### Describe the bug

When I create a card with an embed, such as: `![[file name]]` the embed renders properly. Also there is a little link icon that appears next to it to show it is an embed. On desktop, I can hover preview over this icon, but on the ipad it does not work. (Have mouse with magic keyboard). Embed previews work just fine in normal documents on the ipad, so this functionality can work.

### Expected Behavior

The embed icon when hovered over should provide a preview.

### Steps to reproduce

Embed a link `![[file name]]` in a card
On the ipad try to hover preview it

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

iOS
