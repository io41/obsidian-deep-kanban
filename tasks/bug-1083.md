## Description

### Describe the bug

On an iPhone when I access my kanban board, I am able to effectively and properly sort the tags through whichever of the provided options. The options pop up from the bottom and allow me to click them.

However, on my iPad, the dropdown for sorting tags does not pop up from the bottom. It instead drops down from the three dots in the same fashion as a Windows/MacOS device (idk about Linux, but please correct me if I’m wrong). Since iPad’s do not have an active hover feature for apps that don’t explicitly support them, hovering over the “Sort tags by” does not work and I’m unable to sort my tags for this reason.

### Expected Behavior

Should be able to sort tags in the same style as an iPhone on an iPad.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a kanban board on an iPad.

Create a few cards with either kanban dates, tags, differing text lengths, or any combination of them.

Attempt to sort these tags using the three dots feature, where the dropdown for “Sort tags by” pops up. Attempt to press this further to get the different tag sorting options, however, they will not show up.

### Relevant errors (if available)
