## Description

### Describe the bug

Hi,
every time I open Settings > Community plugins > Kanban > Options, then I have to quit Obsidian. Scrolling up and down in the window works. No other user interface element or keyboard shortcut of Obsidin app or plugin options responds. Not even close button. It is possible to quit application from macOS menu or force quit from Dock.
This plugin is only one I came across with this problem. And I tested dozens of them.

Tested on macOS 13, Obsidian 1.1.9, Obsidian Kanban Plugin 1.5.1.

### Expected Behavior

All UI elements of Options window and Obsidian app should respond…

### Steps to reproduce

1. open Obsidian Settings > Community plugins > Kanban > Options
2. try to click on any button or use UI any other way

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

macOS
