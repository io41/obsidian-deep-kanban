## Description

### Describe the bug

Using "Copy Link to Card" links does not scroll to card that link refers to. 

### Expected Behavior

I expected board to be already scrolled to relevant list (horizontally) and relevant card in that list (vertically). And also some indication to appear on linked card

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create new Kanban board with many lists and cards
2. Use "Copy Link to Card"
3. Use copied link in default obsidian note
4. Try to open it
5. Find it opens board without any way to know which card was actually referred by that link

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
