## Description

### Describe the bug

When there is one card and you create a second one by "duplicate card", change title and contents so they are different.
Then "Copy Link to Card" will result in an identical link no matter which card you copy the link from (the link shows to the first/original card).

### Expected Behavior

"Copy Link to Card" used for the second card should create a different link.

### Steps to reproduce

1. create a card 
2. create a second card by "duplicate card"
3. change title and contents of the second card so they are different
4. "Copy Link to Card" at the first card and paste it into a note
5. "Copy Link to Card" at the second card and paste it into the same note below the first link
6. both link are the same and link to the first card

### Relevant errors (if available)
