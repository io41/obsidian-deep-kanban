## Description

### Describe the bug

I have a kanban board which has almost three hundred cards in it. When I try moving a card, everything slows down extremely and there’re high delays between card positions while moving

### Expected Behavior

Tapped card should move fast without delays.

### Steps to reproduce

Try creating kanban with 100+ cards and test it’s card moving speed in obsidian mobile.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

iOS (iPhone SE 1st gen, tested on iPhone SE 2nd gen (not mine) and there's not such problem, so it may be related either to the exactly 1st gen of SE or optimization of the algorithm used while moving cards in a board)
