investigation_notes: "Blockquotes and callouts not rendering correctly. Related to #550 (Dataview rendering). The markdown renderer in MarkdownRenderer.tsx may not be handling all block-level elements. Callout icons specifically require Obsidian's postprocessor."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When entering in Blockquote syntax, or entering in a callout, neither work properly upon hitting shift+enter and letting it render; Blockquotes do not show up at all, and Callouts are missing their respective icons.

### Expected Behavior

Kanban items should render exactly the same as reading mode when viewing notes.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a kanban item, type in anything starting with either "> " or "> [!my_callout]", and hit enter/shift+enter (as your configuration is set to).

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
