## Description

### Describe the bug

Drag and drop (moving cards or columns) doesn't work at all on Obsidian v0.15.9 after the plugin updated to version 1.3.2.

I couldn't get drag and drop to work even with a fresh vault and resorted to downgrading the plugin. Drag and drop still works on v1.2.40, but not on any of the versions after it that I tried.

Obsidian version: v0.15.9
Installer version: v0.15.9
Operating system: #1 SMP Debian 5.10.127-2 (2022-07-23) 5.10.0-16-amd64
Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)

### Expected Behavior

Dragging and dropping columns and cards should work.

### Steps to reproduce

On Debian bullseye:
1. Attempt to move the columns by dragging and dropping
2. Attempt to move the cards by dragging and dropping

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
When I start dragging a card (to no effect) and then click a link to another note (closing the Kanban board), I get an error:

plugin:obsidian-kanban:67 Event emitted with no handler dragEnd undefined
emit @ plugin:obsidian-kanban:67
dragEnd @ plugin:obsidian-kanban:27
v @ plugin:obsidian-kanban:27


This is probably insignificant, but I can find this message when enabling verbose logs. This message is sent every time I drag and drop even on v1.2.40, when drag and drop works:

plugin:obsidian-kanban:27 [Violation] Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking 'touchstart' event. Consider marking event handler as 'passive' to make the page more responsive. See https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5745543795965952
eval @ plugin:obsidian-kanban:27
cl @ plugin:obsidian-kanban:23

```
