investigation_notes: "Date showing both as raw @{...} and as formatted chip. Parser recognizes date (dateStr is set) but deletion may not be working correctly. Related to #808, #871. Fixed by making preprocessTitle hide inline dates/times when moveDates is true - this ensures any dates that slip through the deletion mechanism are hidden since they appear in the chip area."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When I add a date to a card the templated date keeps showing.

I have (as seen) relative date showing and hide display card toggled off.
If I toggle on hide date in display cards the date in the chip disappears but the @{...} formatting keeps showing.
