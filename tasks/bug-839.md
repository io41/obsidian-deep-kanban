## Description

### Describe the bug

When modifying the markdown file of a kanban board in a text editor (say changing the lane of the card), it results in the open Kanban board being switched to markdown mode most of the time. I haven't been able to figure out why it occasionally works.

I can manually switch back to Kanban mode and everything works fine. The syntax (in the text editor) is exactly the same as if the cards were moved using the board.

### Expected Behavior

Board should reflect the latest changes, and remain in markdown mode, even if the file is modified outside of Obsidian.

### Steps to reproduce

Example file below. Move "test card" back and forth between lanes using a text editor.

```
---

kanban-plugin: basic

---

## test

- [ ] Test card


## test2





%% kanban:settings
\```
{"kanban-plugin":"basic"}
\```
%%
```
