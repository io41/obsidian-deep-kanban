investigation_notes: "Date picker regex only matched the current shouldLinkDates format. If setting changed after date creation (e.g., from @{date} to @[[date]] format), the regex wouldn't match and replacement would silently fail. Fixed by making the regex match ALL date formats regardless of current setting."
