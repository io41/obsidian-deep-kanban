## Description

### Describe the bug

Regardless of theme or font choice, sub-bullet checkboxes are cut off when rendered in a kanban card: 

![Screen Shot 2023-01-03 at 10 29 44 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1744971/210399632-8b2acc03-a73d-477c-8689-ab1f9f65345b.png)

I extensively use this "subtask" type layout and just noticed this change to the visual. I've tried 3 different themes in light/dark to look for differences but they all are missing the left-most column of pixels that complete the box. 

### Expected Behavior

The box should be visible even as a subbullet.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a card with subbullets following this format: 

Primary task
- [ ] subtask
- [ ] subtask
- [x] subtask

And you'll see what I mean.
