## Description

### Describe the bug

Hi. When I use the option to "Add date" to a card, in addition to the date (e.g., 2023-08-04) appearing in small type below the card text, the apparent code for the date (e.g., `@{2023-08-04}`) also appears in the card box.

### Expected Behavior

I assume, based on examples I've see online, that only the small type version of the date should appear.

### Steps to reproduce

Step 1 of 3: I click the three vertical dots on the right side of a card.

Step 2 of 3: I select "Add date"

Step 3 of 3: I click on a date

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

macOS
