## Description

### Describe the bug

I have not been using Kanaban in Obsidian for a while. Now when I show Notice, which used to work with Kanaban, it just shows chaos. When I switch to Markdown, everything seems fine. But then it is also impossible to switch back to Kanaban (where and how? context menu is missing).
