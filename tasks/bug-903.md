## Description

### Describe the bug

On my Kanaban boards the checkboxes are somewhat purpleish. And when you check them the check marks dont fit within the borders. Happens with the checkbox feature of the Kanban Plugin, as well as manually added boxes ( - [ ]).

First example on my desktop PC
![checkboxes](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/assets/125805598/e14b806a-426d-4984-843c-e0245875ff81)

On my laptop:
![checkboxes2](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/assets/125805598/0c8e9407-329b-4c19-a2a3-2039a38a220b)

Theme: Default
CSS Snippets: None

Kanban Plugin 1.5.3
Obsidian 1.5.8
OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 19045) (19041.vb_release.191206-1406)

### Expected Behavior

They should NOT be purple and the checked mark should stay within the limits of the checkbox,

### Steps to reproduce

Manually add a checkbox on a Kanban board
Activate the plugins feature for checkboxes on all items.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system
