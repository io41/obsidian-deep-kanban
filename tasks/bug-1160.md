## Description

### Describe the bug

When I drag a link from my browser to the Kanban board and drop it, it is opened in the browser (or Obsidian's web viewer, if enabled).

The root cause is that the drop event is not given a preventDefault() call before it bubbles.

### Expected Behavior

The URL should not be opened.

### Steps to reproduce

Drag a link from a Web browser and drop it on a kanban board (Obsidian 1.9.12, latest installer)


### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell

```

### Operating system

Windows
