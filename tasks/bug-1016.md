## Description

### Describe the bug

### Description
When you have cards which already have tags in them, and you want to create a note from that card, the note created contains the tags in the title and the tags are removed from the kanban board view and become part of the link.

### Example
Let's say you have a card which has the following text `Task 1 #Tag1`. If I click on `New note from card`, The note created has a title of `Task 1 Tag1` and the card text changes to `[[Task 1 Tag1]]` which makes the tag disappear.

### Visual Example
|Action|Picture|
|:--------:|:--------:|
|Create a note with tag/tags|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f270fac-2477-4d99-a208-dddb5dd26c26)|
|Click on `New note from card`|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/219c2c44-5ee3-4939-8bf0-29debcf6e3c8)|
|The output is a note with title `Task 1 Tag1` and the card text is changed to `[[Task 1 Tag1]]`|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78c49db8-f49d-4849-9548-14538c87c908)|



### Expected Behavior

I think that the tags should not be removed from the card text.

I also think that the tags should not be part of the title. Maybe have a settings which enables the user to choose if they want the tags to be added in the file properties, or if they want the tags to be part of the title.

### Steps to reproduce

- Create new or use and existing kanban board
- Insert a new card to a list
- Name the card and add tag/tags
- Click on `More options` on the card
- Click on `New note from card`
- The card text changes and removes the tags
