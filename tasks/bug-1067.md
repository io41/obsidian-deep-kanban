issue: 1067
title: Latex tripping up card content
url: https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/issues/1067

os: Windows
status: fixed
investigation_notes: "LaTeX expressions in cards cause text to move unexpectedly. Root cause: blockid parser extension was too greedy, accepting any non-space characters after ^. This conflicted with LaTeX superscript syntax like $x^2$ - the ^2$ was being parsed as a block ID. Fixed by restricting blockid extension to only accept alphanumeric characters and hyphens ([a-zA-Z0-9-]), matching what Obsidian actually uses for block IDs."
