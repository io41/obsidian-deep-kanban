## Description

### Describe the bug

Hi! 

Changes I made working on my laptop are not synced to my phone. And then unfortunately the phone version is synced back (without the chance to retrieve the newer version via note version history; there was only a far older version available). I did actually see the changes I made when I looked at my Kanban note again this morning on my laptop - copied the note to another one. But somehow still it "later" changed to the version before my (rather extensive) changes that was synced from the mobile application.

Would be interesting to know if anybody else has encountered something like this - or if there could be a conflict with other plugins or else.

(using Windows 11 on laptop and iOS on phone)

### Expected Behavior

The version with the latest changes should have been synced with all applications (mobile or whatever).

### Steps to reproduce

Make changes on "laptop". See changes NOT syncing to mobile device. See changes then being reverted on "laptop". (Must admit that so far I have not reproduced intentionally in this way)

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
