## Description

### Describe the bug

The template I have preset within the kanban board has a templater script to add a number to the start of the note title (A1, A2, A3 etc). The idea is to create a unique id counting upwards to give each task a unique identifier that isn't huge. Tasks I work on for different projects will sometimes have the same note title, eg "Export Brand Guidelines".

When I run the template with the templater script through the kanban, the note title is updated to include the latest number, but the linked note title within the kanban card doesn't update and becomes unlinked saying "is not created yet, click to create".

### Expected Behavior

I thought that after running the script the linked note title would update within the Kanban card.

### Steps to reproduce

The only way I can get it to render correctly within the list is if I create a linked note, then within the note, manually insert the template with the templater script (via the command palette). It then updates the title within the kanban list. But I don't get why it doesn't update when automated?
