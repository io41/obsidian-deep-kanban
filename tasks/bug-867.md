## Description

### Describe the bug

I am trying to import an other part of the file (list) to a card, like nested list.
When i check a card, the checkbox is not updated on the file import instantly, i need to re-open the file for it to display as checked.

### Expected Behavior

The display of both check-box is the same.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a Kanban file, and enable the option "Display Card Checkbox"
Create two list : one with a classic card, and one with a card of the form ![[File#Part]]
When you check the checkbox of the classic list, the nested one is not updated instantly.

Exemple :

## Nested

- [ ] ![[Kanban_File#List]]

## List

- [ ] Task
