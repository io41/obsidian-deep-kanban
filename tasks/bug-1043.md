## Description

### Describe the bug

I frequently use page metadata in my kanbans, to show the most important tasks of a page, and to be able to modify/complete them right there. 
I use the Page metadata with a dataview script that shows a Task plugin query. 

this was working up to version 1.5.3 of the kanban plugin. 
Since then it is broken. 

It still displays everything correctly, but the checkbox cannot be clickked anymore.
Same applies if just dataview.js is used. 

### Expected Behavior

When I click one of the checkboxes of a task, they should be completed in the task plugin.
The link and the edit button of the task work, just not the checkbox.
![grafik](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06082032-021d-4231-a853-fa156a3a69e2)

It worked till version 1.5.3.

### Steps to reproduce

needs Dataview and Task Plugin.

- add this metadata to a page: taskList:: `$= dv.view("inlineSoloEffortTaskList", {file: "PAGE NAME"})`
- have some tasks in this file

- make a new kanban board and in the settings add linked page metadata: taskList. And check the box with "Field contains markdown".

- Now open as kanban board. 
- add task that inlcudes a link to the page with the metadata. 
- now the kanban should show under the task with the page, all the uncompleted tasks in this page. 
- it looks and behaves like the task plugin, besides clicking the checkbox, this never works. It's possible to click the link of the task, or change the date, but it is not possible to check the checkbox.

content of inlineSoloEffortTaskList.js
const page = dv.page(input.file);
const filePath = page.file.path; // Get the path of the current file

// Construct a condition to search only within the current file
const fileCondition = `path includes ${filePath}`;

// Task query for 'In Progress'
const inProgressQuery = `
not done
${fileCondition}
(heading includes Up Next) OR (heading includes In Progress)
sort by heading
hide task count
short mode
`;


console.log("In Progress Query:", inProgressQuery);

// Displaying the 'In Progress' query
dv.paragraph(`\`\`\`tasks\n${inProgressQuery}\n\`\`\`\n\n`);
