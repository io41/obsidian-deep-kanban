## Description

### Describe the bug

The application will not add cards through the "add card" function. It looks like neither the [enter] of [shift-enter] triggers the entry of the card into the list. If I manually add cards in the mark-down they are picked up. Duplication of cards works but the "enter-keys" are not recognized so cards are neither added to the list or changes to existing cards are not 'accepted' 

Pressing the enter-key **ALWAYS** gives a newline in the card text. I reinstalled the plugin but to no avail. I tried changing the entry in the settings to see if this made a difference but it didn't.

It seems most of the other functionality is OK, I can drag files into the list to add cards this way but again I can't change/add any of the text on the card once it is created.

### Expected Behavior

When I create a new card through the +Add Card button function and enter either the [enter-key] or [shift enter-key] as configured i settings should enter an new card or update the text of an existing card.

### Steps to reproduce

1. fresh install and enabled KANBAN plugin
2. create a new KANBAN board
3. leave all defaults in the settings
4. create list
5. add new card
6. focus stays on card content
7. [shift enter] inserts line below cursor position
8. [enter] inserts empty line above cursor position
9. only using mouse cursor will exit out of text entry
10. result is NO new card and a clean [+Add Card Button]
