## Description

### Describe the bug

If the kanban is set to color the card date with a certain rule, _all_ the dates present in the card inside dataview fields (and not just the date marked as the card field date `@{YYYY-MM-DD}`) are colored accordingly.

It seems than only dates present in dataview fields are affected: if a date is written in the card text without markers, it is correctly not recognized.

### Expected Behavior

Only the date marked with the kanban marker `@{...}` should be colored according to the rules.

### Steps to reproduce

just put a date (triggering a date coloring rule) as a dataview inline field (with any field name).

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
