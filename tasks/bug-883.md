investigation_notes: "Grey lozenge appearing on short titles (macOS only, not Windows). CSS rendering issue in markdown-preview-view. The lozenge appears to be some hidden element with visible background. Selector identified in bug report. macOS-specific CSS rendering difference. Fixed by adding CSS to reset background on inner wrapper divs in lane titles."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When the title of a list or card is short, a grey lozenge appears to the right of the text. The lozenge performs no function.

### Expected Behavior

This behavior is seen in MacOS Obsidian. When opening the same vault in Windows, the kanban looks correct:

## Some Context

It appears to be some rendering issue in the css class:

markdown-preview-view kanban-plugin__markdown-preview-view

Drilling down in the developer tools:

`<div class="markdown-preview-view kanban-plugin__markdown-preview-view"><div><p>Now</p></div></div>`

and the selector covers now and the lozenge:

Selector: body > div.app-container > div.horizontal-main-container > div > div.workspace-split.mod-vertical.mod-root > div > div.workspace-tab-container > div > div > div.view-content > div > div > div > div:nth-child(1) > div > div.kanban-plugin__lane-header-wrapper > div.kanban-plugin__lane-title > div > div

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a kanban.
2. Add a list or card with a short name (bug).
3. Add a list with a very long name (no bug).

### Relevant errors (if available)

### Operating system
