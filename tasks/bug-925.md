## Description

### Describe the bug

When I first used this plugin and would enter a new item, there would be a button directly under, after typing, to add it to the list. I can't remember the title of that button. It's not there now. Now I select to add a new card, type in my info, and.... nothing. Enter doesn't work. There's no button for adding it. No command options to do it. Not sure what to do. Everything is updated, restarted etc.

### Expected Behavior

There needs to be a way to ADD or enter or whatever, the new card content to the list. It's just.... sitting there. 

### Steps to reproduce

? Go to Kanban, click + Add a card, type in content.... then nothing. The button that used to be there to add things isn't there. Enter doesn't do it. 

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system
