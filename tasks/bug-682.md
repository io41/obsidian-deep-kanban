## Description

### Describe the bug

On startup Obsidian does not enable this plugin. Manually enabling on the list of installed plugins fails and shows a "Failed to enable plugin" toast. Going into the community Plugin list and pressing the enable button there causes the same error, but the plugin enables and functions correctly despite the error.

Note: I am experiencing this error on 2 Windows systems and an Ubuntu Linux system.

### Expected Behavior

I expect the plugin to be enabled on startup.

### Steps to reproduce

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install the latest Obsidian (1.0.3) on Windows or Linux
2. Install the latest version of this plugin
3. Attempt to enable the plugin
4. See error in console

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
app.js:1 Plugin failure: obsidian-kanban DOMException: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.
