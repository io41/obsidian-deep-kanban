## Description

### Describe the bug

I have set up a template which turns a new daily note into a kanban. I experienced two issues.

1. When the last daily note is reopened, the content not displayed into the kanban (like paragraphs which are listed items) is lost.

2. I recently a worse version of the same issue: I lost all content of today's daily note after closing and reopening Obsidian.

Here is the list of plugins I had enabled while the two issues occurred.

Issue 1: Kanban plugin, daily note plugin (the one built-into Obsidian), obligator plugin (https://github.com/Newbrict/obsidian-obligator)
Issue 2: Kanban plugin, daily note plugin, templater plugin (https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater), rollover daily todos (https://github.com/lumoe/obsidian-rollover-daily-todos)

I believe the issue is likely related to Kanban plugin because when disabled, the issue did not happen. It seems to me that when I open today's daily note, it is automatically opened as a Kanban, and this is the moment where data is lost.

For both issues I used the following `kanban:settings` at the bottom of the page.
```
{"kanban-plugin":"basic","new-card-insertion-method":"prepend","show-checkboxes":true}
```
And I use the following property at the head of the page.
```
kanban-plugin: basic
```
In Issue 1, these above configurations are written in the obligator plugin's template file.
In Issue 2, the configurations are written in a template file managed by templater.

### Expected Behavior

When I open the note, all of the text data should remain, even data that is not displayed in the Kanban mode, so that I do not worry that a bug like this would wipe out the content all of a sudden.


### Steps to reproduce

- Install the plugins I listed above
- Write some content which is not displayed in Kanban mode, that is, not listed items.
- Close/reopen the file
- Close/reopen Obsidian

### Relevant errors (if available)
