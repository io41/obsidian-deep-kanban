## Description

### Describe the bug

I have a bunch of dataview inline fields I use in my tasks. Among them if a field is named `due` it is not recognized when I set the plugin to move all dataview inline fields in the footer or to merge them with linked page metadata.

- The dataview field is written correctly (I used it regularly with dataview in other notes and it works perfectly).
- I tried with different other field names, and it seems that only `due` is affected.
- The bug persists also if the field `due` contains data types other than dates (strings, numbers, etc.)
- Apparently no error appears in the log output

### Expected Behavior

The dataview filed `due` should be moved at the card footer together with other dataview fields (see attached image above where instead it remains in the card body).

### Steps to reproduce

Just put a `[due::something]` dataview field in a kanban card and set kanban either to move dataview inline fields in the card footer or to merge them with linked page metadata.

In the following the test markdown code used to generate the case in the image above is reported:
