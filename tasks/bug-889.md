issue: 889

investigation_notes: "Extensive code review completed. Tags flow: list.ts:136 marks tags for deletion when move-tags=true, list.ts:194 applies executeDeletion to remove them. ItemContent.tsx renders item.data.title (with tags removed) and Tags component only shows when move-tags=true. MarkdownRenderer useEffect (line 344-355) updates preview when markdownString changes. Preview cache (previewCache) is keyed by item.id and updates content via set() method. Code logic appears correct. Unable to identify bug without reproduction - likely user configuration issue (move-tags setting) or rare edge case. Recommend asking reporter: 1) What is their move-tags setting value? 2) Did they recently change the setting? 3) Does refreshing the board fix it?"
