## Description

### Describe the bug

If I maximize a kanban secondary window (e.g. by double-clicking the Obsidian title bar, drag and drop stops working in it.

### Expected Behavior

It should not stop working.

### Steps to reproduce

Using 1.3.12 and Obsidian 0.15.9, open a kanban in a new window (I'm right-clicking a link to one). Attempt drag-drop, it works.  Maximize the window, it stops working and gets the error shown below (repeatedly).

### Relevant errors (if available)
