investigation_notes: "Flatpickr uses 'now' property to mark today in calendar. The date picker in helpers.ts wasn't passing now: new Date(), causing it to use the stale default. Fixed by adding now: new Date() option."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When adding a date to a card, the current date is marked with a border, however this date does not change if obsidian is left running for multiple days, it stays at the date obsidian was opened on.

### Expected Behavior

The day marked as 'current day' should change according to the actual date, if this is not possible maybe reload the current date on opening the kanban board.

### Steps to reproduce

1. leave obsidian open for more than one day
2. the 'current day' will still display the date from when obsidian was opened

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
