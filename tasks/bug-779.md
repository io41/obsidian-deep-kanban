## Description

### Describe the bug

If kanban is opened in a split pane (i.e. "Split Right" from tab context menu) then typing in the original pane  (e.g. the left pane) is affected by significant lag. Tested by replacing kanban in the right pane with other pages and even the kanban source code view. Typing lag is only affected when kanban is open. It basically makes Obsidian unusable.

Obsidian v1.2.8
Kanban plugin 1.5.2 and 1.5.3
Intel Xeon E5-1650
64GB RAM
GTX-980


### Expected Behavior

No typing lag

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open obsidian to a normal markdown page
2. Select "Split Right" from tab context menu
3. In right pane, set content to be the kanban page/plugin
4. Test typing in the left pane

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system
