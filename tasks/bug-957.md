## Description

### Describe the bug

When I right click a card and choose New Note from Card, and there is a tag in the card title, the link to the created note breaks. It appears that it is trying to insert the tag in the link.

### Expected Behavior

1. Create new card: `testy test #test`
2. Click New Note from Card
3. New file called `testy test` is created, title is replaced with `[[testy test]] #test`

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create new card: `testy test #test`
2. Click New Note from Card
3. New file called `testy test #test` is created, title is replaced with `[[Personal/Kanban notes/testy test #test]]`
4. Link is not clickable
