status: fixed
investigation_notes: "Cmd+K (create link shortcut) doesn't work in kanban card editor. The CodeMirror-based editor doesn't have the same keybindings as the main Obsidian editor. Fixed by adding Mod-k keymap handler that wraps selection in markdown link syntax and positions cursor in parentheses."

## Description

### Describe the bug

In this image, I have selected a string of text, and when I click splat-K (on Mac), nothing happens:

### Expected Behavior

I expected the string to form the text of a markdown link, like `[text]()` with the cursor between the parens, so I can then paste the URL. Note that manually adding the brackets and parens, then pasting the URL works.

### Steps to reproduce

See expected behavior.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

macOS
