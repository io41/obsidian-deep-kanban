investigation_notes: "Mobile iOS: 'Add a Card' button goes off screen with 15+ cards in a list. Fixed by adding CSS that makes the lane use proper flexbox layout on mobile: lane-items gets flex:1 with overflow-y:auto so it scrolls, and the button wrapper is flex-shrink:0 with sticky positioning to stay visible at the bottom."

## Description

### Describe the bug

If you add too many cards on mobile (it varies depending on the mobile device) you won't be able to create new cards because the "Add a Card" button gets moved off screen (it gets too low and goes off the screen).

### Expected Behavior

I'd expect for the "add a card" button to always remain visible and clickable even when the list gets long. Preferably for when the button reaches the bottom the screen for it to then remain fixated at the bottom rather than it to continue expanding downwards (this would be better than if you had to scroll down to find it, but even that is not currently an option).

### Steps to reproduce

Create a Kanban board on mobile.
Create a list.
Repeatedly add multiple cards to the list and you will eventually notice that the "Add a Card" button gets too low on the screen and will no longer be able to be viewed nor clicked.
