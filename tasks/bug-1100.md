## Description

### Describe the bug

When in the middle of adding a new card, clicking on anything other than another card, loses the text you've already typed in the "add a card" textbox. This is also the case if you navigate to a different page than the Kanban board.

### Expected Behavior

The in-progress new card should remain in progress, or the user should be asked whether to add the card or lose the changes

### Steps to reproduce

On the board view:

- Start adding a card and type some text into the textbox
- Without hitting `enter` to save the card, click anywhere on the kanban board except an existing card, or navigate to a different Obsidian page
- The in-progress new card's details are lost

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell

```

### Operating system

macOS
