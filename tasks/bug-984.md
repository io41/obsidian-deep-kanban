## Description

### Describe the bug

When I created a list with "Mark card in this list as complete", I did not create a list with the property "Mark card in this list as complete". I need to toggle the setting again via "Edit list".

### Expected Behavior

The list created with "Mark card in this list as complete" should make a list with auto-complete when the card is created there or when the card is moved to this list. No need to toggle again via "Edit list".

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a new list by pressing the (+) button.
2. Type the name of the list.
3. Toggle on "Mark card in this list as complete".
4. When the card is created, check the property with the "Edit list" menu; at this step, the toggle of "Mark card in this list as complete" is still off.
5. Double-check the file by viewing it as Markdown and there are no "**complete**" marks.
