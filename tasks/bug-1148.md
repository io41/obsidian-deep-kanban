## Description

### Describe the bug

Just updated to the latest version 2.0.51 and am experiencing an issue when creating a new list or adding new cards. Issue: the field to write in is huge (vertically). The beheviour seems to be connected to the typewriter scroll plugin which I'm using.

### Expected Behavior

Same as when typewriter scroll plugin is turned off

### Steps to reproduce

### Relevant errors (if available)
