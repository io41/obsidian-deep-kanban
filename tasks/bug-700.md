## Description

### Describe the bug

Using iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard, I can click with the cursor to **+Add a card** and type what I want in the field, but once finished, the **Submit** button does not register the cursor click via the trackpad—at this point only tapping with finger or Apple Pencil works to submit the new card to the board. iPadOS 16.1.1

### Expected Behavior

Clicking on **Submit** with the trackpad cursor should add the card to the board

### Steps to reproduce

I’m a new user testing out this plugin, and this is how it worked out of the box

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

iOS
