## Description

### Describe the bug

Basically what the title says. I found this while trying to access tasks and subtasks saved in Kanban via dataviewjs. What I found was dataviewjs not correctly rendering the subtasks as checkboxes but as plain "- [ ]". I went deeper and found the Kanban plugin not saving those nested tasks/subtasks in markdown.

### Expected Behavior

The plugin should reflect the nested tasks/subtasks in markdown.
