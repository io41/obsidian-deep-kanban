investigation_notes: "CRITICAL: Data loss when opening non-kanban file as kanban. Tables, images, and other content deleted. Parser only preserves headings (lanes) and lists (cards). Fixed by adding hasNonKanbanContent() check and KanbanConversionWarningModal to warn users before opening files that contain non-list content."

## Description

### Describe the bug

Just wanted to try out the plugin. Placed `kanban-plugin: board` into the frontmatter of a note that already had tasks, tables and images included, selected "Open as kanban board", only thing that showed were the tasks, thats fine, thats what I was testing. When I went back to review my markdown, all headings were reverted to h2, all tables were deleted as well as image embeds. 

### Expected Behavior

Previous state of note should be preserved. 

### Steps to reproduce

Create a markdown table with tables and image embeds. Place `kanban-plugin: board` into frontmatter. Select "Open as kanban board", then select "Open as markdown". 

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
