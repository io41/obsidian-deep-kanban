## Description

### Describe the bug

I have a editing + reading split pane layout (left pane for markdown edit, right pane for rendered view). When I open a Kanban board, the left pane is for markdown edit, and right pane is the Kanban board view. However, when I switch to another note (e.g. Ctrl-O), the right pane is set to editing mode instead of staying in reading mode (as expected).

### Expected Behavior

Switching to another node from a split-pane kanban board view should maintain the original edit/read view setting.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Setup the layout such that there are 2 panes, left pane is markdown source edit, right pane is markdown rendered reading view, and the 2 panes are linked.
2. Open an existing kanban board file; the left pane should be markdown source edit, and right pane should be kanban view.
3. Switch back to a regular markdown note. Observe that the right pane is an edit view and no longer reading view.
