## Description

### Describe the bug

It seems that on mobile the Kanban settings tab is positioned incorrectly. In a way that part of the settings tab is not fully covering the entire screen.

I’m on **iOS 17.3.1**, using an **iPhone 13**.

The tab should fully cover the screen.

1. Open up your phone and create a new vault
2. Install Kanban and enable it
3. Create a new board
