issue: 787
title: Plugin reformats `yml` front matter undesirably

investigation_notes: "YAML frontmatter had extra newlines after first --- and before last ---. Fixed by using trim() on stringifyYaml output. Note: array format change [a,b] -> list is from Obsidian's stringifyYaml itself, not fixable here."

## Description

### Describe the bug

It seems that the extension reformats the `yml` front matter. For example, the following:

```md
---
tag: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
kanban-plugin: basic
---
```

gets reformatted as:

```md
---

tag:
  - tag1
  - tag2
  - tag3
  - phd
kanban-plugin:
  - basic

---
```

It is not per se a problem that the array syntax gets turned into a list syntax, but the new line after and before the `---` makes the front matter not `yml` idiomatic. Perhaps some parsers may even fail to process it.

### Expected Behavior

Would it be possible to not reformat the front matter?

### Steps to reproduce

See elaboration in the section *Describe the bug*.

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
None.

P.S. Thanks for the handy plugin!
```


### Operating system

macOS
