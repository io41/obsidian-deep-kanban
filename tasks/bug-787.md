investigation_notes: "YAML frontmatter reformatting issue. Plugin converts inline array [a,b,c] to list format with extra newlines. Frontmatter serialization needs to preserve original format. Related to how js-yaml is configured."

## Description

### Describe the bug

It seems that the extension reformats the `yml` front matter. For example, the following:

```md
---
tag: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
kanban-plugin: basic
---
```

gets reformatted as:

```md
---

tag:
  - tag1
  - tag2
  - tag3
  - phd
kanban-plugin:
  - basic

---
```

It is not per se a problem that the array syntax gets turned into a list syntax, but the new line after and before the `---` makes the front matter not `yml` idiomatic. Perhaps some parsers may even fail to process it.

### Expected Behavior

Would it be possible to not reformat the front matter?

### Steps to reproduce

See elaboration in the section *Describe the bug*.

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
None.

P.S. Thanks for the handy plugin!
```


### Operating system

macOS
