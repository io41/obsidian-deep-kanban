investigation_notes: "Email dragged from AppleMail doesn't show email title as link text. This is a feature request for enhanced drag-drop handling to parse email metadata. Kanban receives raw URL from drag event, not the email title. Would require custom drag data parsing for message:// URLs."

## Description

### Describe the bug

Obsidian v0.13.6
Kanban v.1.2.22

Dragging an email message from AppleMail into a card only displays the link text, not the email title. Dragging the email into a blank Obsidian note displays the email title.

. 

### Expected Behavior

The title of the email should be the title of the link.  I have edited the card to include the link title.

From:
`message:%3C7760619639.4@informz.net%3E`
to:
`[Your Agenda is LIVE for the December Virtual Event!](message:%3C7760619639.4@informz.net%3E)`
