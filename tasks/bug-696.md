## Description

### Describe the bug

I can't get tags to render to the cards on the Kanban board. I'm running Kanban 1.5.1 and Obsidian 1.1.4. No matter where I place the tags in the page they won't show up. Changing the values in the settings doesn't impact anything either. 

I have removed the plugin and reinstalled. I have replaced the version of Obsidian too.

### Expected Behavior

I'm expecting tags to display according to the documentation.

### Steps to reproduce

Launch Obsidian and Kanban. Add a card to the board with tags. No tags display in the cards. Doesn't matter if I add tags to the note or to the card. No tags are rendered.

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
I don't see any errors outside the expected behavior doesn't seem to work
```


### Operating system

macOS
