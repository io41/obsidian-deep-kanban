## Description

### Describe the bug

Thought I would drop a line. Absolutely inconsequential edge case behavior:

When title of Kanban column ends with digits in `( )`, digits are displayed as total # of cards in this column.

### Expected Behavior

Content of the title of the column should not affect counting cards in this column.

### Steps to reproduce

End title of a column with digits in brackets, eg. `(101)`.
