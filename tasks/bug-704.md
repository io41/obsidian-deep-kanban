investigation_notes: "Collapsed callouts ([!note]-) don't expand when clicked in kanban card. The issue was that Obsidian's native callout toggle handlers weren't being invoked because the markdown is rendered in an isolated container. Fixed by adding a click event listener in BasicMarkdownRenderer.render() that detects clicks on .callout-fold or .callout-title and toggles the .is-collapsed class on the parent .callout element."

## Description

### Describe the bug

Unable to display callout contents.

### Expected Behavior

Clicking on a callout should expand it.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a card with a callout, e.g.

```
this is a test

> [!note]- a callout
> this should be hidden by default
```

The card is displayed correctly, but clicking on the arrow does not reveal the callout contents:
