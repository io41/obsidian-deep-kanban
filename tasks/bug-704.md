## Description

### Describe the bug

Unable to display callout contents.

### Expected Behavior

Clicking on a callout should expand it.

### Steps to reproduce

Create a card with a callout, e.g.

```
this is a test

> [!note]- a callout
> this should be hidden by default
```

The card is displayed correctly, but clicking on the arrow does not reveal the callout contents:
