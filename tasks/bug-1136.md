## Description

### Describe the bug

When creating a new note from a Kanban card using a Templater template, the note briefly shows the template content but then the content disappears, leaving an empty note. This happens even with a simple one-line text template.

### Expected Behavior

The new note should keep the content from the Templater template and not disappear after creation.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a simple Templater template with the text "This is a test template."
2. Open a Kanban board in Obsidian.
3. Use the "New note from card" option and select the created template.
4. Observe that the template text appears briefly and then disappears, resulting in a blank note.
