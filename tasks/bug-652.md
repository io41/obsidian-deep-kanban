## Description

### Describe the bug

I moved my Kanban folder inside my Vault, and was going back to fix the default folders. And it shows no options, and I cannot input a new folder location

### Expected Behavior

It should allow me to see the box where I could select my folder location

### Steps to reproduce

have your note folder set. Move your note folder (or its parent folder) to a new location in your vault
