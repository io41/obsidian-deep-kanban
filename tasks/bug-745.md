## Description

### Describe the bug

I have setup some rules to highlight the card's date but dates are not highlighted

### Expected Behavior

Dates are highlighted according to the rules I set in the plugin configuration

### Steps to reproduce

- Create a note and set it's date to today (using the `@` trigger)
- Create a rule in the plugin settings to colour those dates equal to today
