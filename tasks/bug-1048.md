## Description

### Describe the bug
For example, if I assign the color yellow to cards dated for tomorrow and green for today, the date will be yellow the day before and the day of (and thereafter), until I:
- close and reopen Obsidian,
- close and reopen the note,
- or interact with that specific card.

This may or may not be considered a bug within the scope of this plugin. If not, I would like a feature that automatically refreshes date colors on opened kanban notes when the date changes (e.g., when tomorrow becomes today). Alternatively, a manual refresh button would be helpful.

### Expected Behavior
The date color should (ideally) update automatically when the date changes.

### Steps to reproduce
1. Create a date color rule for "today" with green as the color.
2. Create a date color rule for "between now and" 1 day after now with yellow as the color.
3. Create a card dated for tomorrow.
4. Wait until tomorrow without closing Obsidian, closing the note, or interacting with the card.
5. Observe that the date is still yellow (indicating tomorrow) when it should be green (indicating today).

### Operating system

Windows
