investigation_notes: "Clicking lane headers in Obsidian's outline pane causes the kanban view to blank. Root cause: setEphemeralState only handled block IDs (^blockid) but not heading subpaths. When clicking outline, Obsidian sends heading text as subpath. Fixed by adding scrollToLane event handler that finds and scrolls to the matching lane by title."
