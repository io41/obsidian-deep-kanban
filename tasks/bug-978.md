investigation_notes: "Clicking lane headers in Obsidian's outline pane causes the kanban view to blank. This is likely because Obsidian tries to scroll to a heading position that doesn't exist in the same way in the Kanban view. Needs investigation into scroll/navigation event handling."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When I have Kanban note with lists (BACKLOG, TODO, DONE) the headers are visible in the Obsidian outline view.
clicking any of the headers (BACKLOG, TODO, DONE) in the outline pane in the sidebar makes the note go blank.

Do nothing or focus on list under header.

Plugin version 2.0.51, Obsidian 1.5.11

_No response_

### Operating system
