investigation_notes: "Performance issue with 2500+ character cards - typing lags several seconds. Root cause: DateDecorator was calling createDeco() on every document change, which scans the ENTIRE document and recreates all decorations from scratch. Fixed by using updateDeco() instead, which incrementally updates only changed areas and reuses unchanged decorations. This is the standard pattern for CodeMirror decorators."
