investigation_notes: "Complex DnD issue. Lane dragging uses useDragHandle with measureRef/dragHandleRef but the EntityManager registration via intersection observer might have timing issues. Compare to Item.tsx which uses measureRef for both args. The lane-wrapper's hitboxid might not be set when user clicks grip. Needs more investigation."
