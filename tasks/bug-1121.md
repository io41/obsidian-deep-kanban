investigation_notes: "Column resizing in table view is unresponsive when kanban is in a floating/popout window. The tanstack-table getResizeHandler() attaches mousemove/mouseup listeners to the main document, not the popout window's document. Fixed by creating a custom resize handler that uses e.view.document to attach listeners to the correct document."

## Description

### Describe the bug

When you have the kanbanboard (table Mode) in a seperate Window, not in the main Obsidian Window, the Collumn-Resizing is unresponsive. It sometimes snaps to the max or the min value, but you cant really resize it accuratly. Only happens in a seperate window.  

### Expected Behavior

It should work like in the main window.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Open Table View of the Kanban Board
2. Drag and Drop the Tab onto desktop, creating a new Window. 
3. Try to Resize the Column-Width by clicking on the dividing lines in the Header

It does only happen in a flowing window, not in a Tab. 

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell

```

### Operating system

Windows
