## Description

### Describe the bug

Hi, 
First of all, thanks a lot, Kanban is a great tool ! :)
I noticed some serious slow down since the update Obsidian 1.0. : when I want to open a "new note from card", it "opens to the rignt", but there is a 1second delay between what I type and what is displayed

### Expected Behavior

less delay

### Steps to reproduce

from an existing card with note, select "Open to the right", and try to type something on the note file : it will have a delay

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows
