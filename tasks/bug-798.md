## Description

### Describe the bug

# Problem Statement

Custom task statuses are not preserved when items are moved between sections of the file.

# Environment

- Windows 11
- Obsidian for Windows
  - obsidian-kanban
  - obsidian-tasks
    with *custom statuses* enabled

# Research

In reproducing the issue, I found that the issue did not occur until an item was moved between sections.

### Expected Behavior

# Expected Behavior

Task checkboxes ``[ ], [x]`` should retain 'custom' characters between square brackets for interoperability with other extensions.

### Steps to reproduce

# Steps to Reproduce

1. Open new Kanban board.
2. Create lanes/sections.
3. Add card(s) to lane(s).
4. Open Kanban board as Markdown
5. Use Tasks plugin to format card(s) as ``#task`` items with custom status ``[/], [-], [>], etc.``
6. Archive card(s) from one of the lanes, or drag a card between lanes.
  *Both actions move item(s) from one section of the file to another.*
7. Close and re-open Kanban board (in board mode) -- when it is reopened as Markdown, all the statuses are 'reset' with the standard ``[ ], or [x]``
