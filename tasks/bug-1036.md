## Description

### Describe the bug

When i add a due date onto a task, it does not automatically update the "in 3 days" or whatever unless obsidian has been restarted. OR the task is re-edited.

### Expected Behavior

The 'in 3 days' should update to 'in 2 days' after a day, without restarting obsidian.

### Steps to reproduce

Set a date on a task and wait a day without restarting obsidian.

### Relevant errors (if available)

_No response_

### Operating system

macOS
