## Description

### Describe the bug

If you make a card with a URL at its title and click "new note from card" the URL is discarded.

For instance, if the card contains
```md
Hello [world](https://hello.world)
```
the created note will have `Hello world` as its title, and the URL `https://hello.world` is gone.

#494 is related.

### Expected Behavior

I'm not sure what should happen, since the URL cannot be the name of the resulting card. It makes sense that the URL text is what's left, but perhaps the newly created card should contain the URL that was implicitly removed. Or maybe there should be a warning? Or maybe this should be disallowed altogether.

### Steps to reproduce

Make a card with the following text
```md
Hello [world](https://hello.world)
```
and click "New note from card". The text of the card is now
```md
[[Hello world]]
```
the `Hello world` card is blank, and the URL `https://hello.world` is gone.
