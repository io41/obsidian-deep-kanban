## Description

### Describe the bug

I cannot see that toggling the setting "Tag sort order" does anything. I have an explicit order set but when I hit that toggle, nothing changes. If I reorder the list, nothing changes. If I reload or restart Obsidian, nothing changes. This is true whether or not I have the tags set to display in the footer.

I have checked the docs and read through issues here and I have not figured it out.
What exactly is this setting for? What does it do?

### Expected Behavior

I am not sure. I was hoping it would sort the display order of the tags in each card.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Click toggle for "Tag sort order" to "on" position
2. Add tags using "Add tag" field
3. ?

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell

```

### Operating system

Windows
