## Description

### Describe the bug

I have Tasks v7.4.0 and Kanban v2.0.51 and the task pane comes up (woo hoo!) but it stays up after the card(s) are created. The only way to get this to stop is to open the file as markdown or go to another file and back to this kanban board. Clicking anywhere doesn't fix it nor does changing the viewing from a kanban to a table or a board.

Also, it comes up in the creation of the lists as well. So, when Headers are created (in the markdown) with the plugin, it tries to add dates and everything.

Also, adding a start date causes the date picker to be stuck on the screen:

You can barely see that behind the date picker, the start date is there.

### Expected Behavior

Tasks Pane & Date Picker should both disappear once you add the task or *at least* when you click away from the input field.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Install Tasks
2. Restart Obsidian
3. Install BRAT
4. Setup Kanban in BRAT
5. Restart Obsidian (for good measure)
6. Create a board
7. Create a list -> You should see the tasks pane come up.
8. Click away after creating list -> Tasks pane stays up.
9. Create a card in that list -> Error from previous Bug Report should appear
10. Once card is created task pane should stay up, click away from board anywhere else in Obsidian, tasks pane stays up until you view the board as markdown.

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
No errors in console.
```


### Operating system
