## Description

### Describe the bug

when I enter a date for a note (with '@'), there is a popup, that can be navigated by using the cursor keys:

When I set Monday as the start of the week, the calendar displays properly, but when I navigate to Saturday by using the cursor keys

and hit right, it jumps to the next month instead of Sunday:
