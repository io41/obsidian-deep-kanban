## Description

### Describe the bug

When writing a multine codeblock inside a kanban card, the text gets rendered outside of the code block.

### Expected Behavior

When writing multiline codeblocks inside a card, it should be rendered as expected inside that codeblock.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a kanban board
2. Create a list
3. Create a card
4. Inside of that card, write a multiline codeblock like:
```python
print('Line 1')
print('Line 2')
```
