investigation_notes: "Markdown links (vs wikilinks) cause issues with date selector path to daily notes. The buildLinkToDailyNote function was using encodeURIComponent which over-encodes paths (e.g., spaces become %20). Fixed by creating encodeMarkdownLinkPath that only encodes parentheses which break markdown link syntax."
