## Description

### Describe the bug

I have a list called "Complete" with the option "Mark cards in this list as complete" enabled. When I move a card to that list it is **not** marked as complete.

### Expected Behavior

The card should be marked as complete

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a list
2. Edit list to set "Mark cards in this list as complete" (related to #984)
3. Move a card to the new list

### Relevant errors (if available)

```shell
Nothing in the log.
```


### Operating system

macOS
