## Description

### Describe the bug

When using "New note from card," if the note folder specified in the board settings is more than two folders deep, contents from the specified template is inserted twice into the note.

For example, if the specified folder is Writing/Fiction/MyNovel, the front matter inserted from my template looks like this:

```
---
viewpoint:
characters:
setting:
time:
---
---
viewpoint:
characters:
setting:
time:
---
```

### Expected Behavior

The text from the template should be inserted in the note only once. It should look like this:
```
---
viewpoint:
characters:
setting:
time:
---
```
### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a series of folders three levels deep, such as Writing/Fiction/MyNovel.
2. Right click the third-level folder (MyNovel).
3. Click "New kanban board."
4. In the board settings, select the note template you want to use.
5. In the board settings, select the three-deep note folder.
6. In the kanban, create a list and then a card.
7. Click the card's three-dot menu and then click "New note from card."
8. Check out the doubled text in the note.
