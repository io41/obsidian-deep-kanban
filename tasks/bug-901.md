## Description

### Describe the bug

Pressing an image to enlarge it (magnifying) in a card down a long list, either displays a cropped enlarged version of the image in its card or just hides the image I pressed in the card.

### Expected Behavior

Show an enlarged version of the image in the middle of the list (or preferably, in the middle of the board so you can see an even larger version of the image).

### Steps to reproduce

1. **Create a kanban board with a list**.
2. **Create multiple cards with an image in each**, enough so you would have to scroll down a lot, try 40 though it would probably still happen with a lot less depending on the size of the images (can just drag and drop a folder with multiple images to automatically create a card for each).
3. **(without moving the cards) Click on each image in each card as you scroll down** and notice that the enlarged image only shows at the top of the list which doesn't move with the scrolling, eventually clicking on an image on hides it in the card (because the top of the list isn't visible anymore. If you moved the cards 4 happens, close and open the kanban board to reproduce 3.
4. **Move some cards around and click an image** to see that now the image shows an enlarged version in the bounds of its card (making it cropped). The card also shrinks because it hides the image that is contained within it when you try to enlarge it.

The last 2 steps are separate issues, you don't need to scroll to see 4 happen.
