## Description

### Describe the bug

When i create a callout inside a card, the logo of the callout is not displayed

### Expected Behavior

When i create a callout inside a card, the logo of the callout should be displayed.
Like this : 
<img width="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/assets/37228391/aea257b9-fd80-46c4-afd8-758e7cb679b6">

This to get a better understanding of the state of the kanban board


### Steps to reproduce

When i write in a card : 
```md
>[!todo]
> things to do
```
the callout is displayed in the color of the type (blue for a todo) but the logo is not displayed.

Might be a feature for a later update or a bug.
