## Description

### Describe the bug

If I create a card with the title

`my description #mytag [created:: 2023-10-22]`  and click on create note from card, it will create the new note but the card will not have a link to it. If I instead use `my description [created:: 2023-10-22]  #mytag` (with the tag at the end) it will create the new note and the card will have a link to it, but the card will lose the field format.


### Expected Behavior

if I create a note with the content `my description #mytag [created:: 2023-10-22]` and create a note from it, I would like the new note to have title just `my description` and the card be updated to `[[my description]] #mytag [created:: 2023-10-22]` leaving the tag and field outside the link

### Steps to reproduce

add task  `my description #mytag [created:: 2023-10-22]`  to a board and create note from card.
